# Exodus_Campaign
THe application is a routinely updated living narrative set in the Warhammer 40000 setting with regularly updated rules and crusade lists of those who are playing in the narrative.  As players win or lose they inform the developers who then write the next mission set to reflect what has happened in the story.

### TEchnologies Used:
Only Bootstrap has been used as it was a test exercise to understand the grid system and functionality of bootstrap.  As my backend knowledge improves the plan is to make this a fully self-dependent application which is a social media for custom crusade lists and ability to tell a crusade story based on wins and losses.

Because this is fan-made project there is a chance that the developer will be asked to take down the applciation if I am not careful.
