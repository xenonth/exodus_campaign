        <p class= "lead">
            The galaxy is in a never-ending state of war. Wars which have been raging for centuries.  Every year the Imperium waxes and wanes.  The enemies within and without are legion.  In this constant conflict a meeting was held between Inquisitors who believed that the Imperium of Mann had no future in this galaxy unless they expanded beyond this galaxy.  To most in the inquisition this topic would be considered heretical and Exterminatus declared on the entire system where this meeting would be held.  A plan was formed, now referred to as the Exodus Project. In time it would be known as the Exodus Gambit.
        </p>
        <p class= "lead">
          The plan would be to gather a crusade force to search the space between in hopes of finding one of the lost Primarch’s.  With a secondary objective being to settle new worlds...  
        </p>
        <p class= "lead">    
            Only the brave, desperate or insane would be willing to follow this request.  However, in their way to the void would be imperium agents, cult insurgencies and the xenos.  Imperium agents who would view this action as cowardice and heretical.  Chaos, an easy way to destroy a quantifiable size of the anathema’s forces.  Xenos, it would depend on the faction’s perspective.
