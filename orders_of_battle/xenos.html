        <!--fluff--><p>
            The Shelwe-Inn craftworld lies within the Tau empire and is more akin to a corsair fleet then a 'craftworld'. When the offer came, the conclave and high Farseer forsore to send a detachment, half wraith half aspect as this journey would not be an easy one and will most likely result in failure.  Giving orders to Spiritseer Mor'ta'ley supported by two upcoming warlocks aided by a small aspect warrior battalionand a wraithhost vanguard. This is the Exodus Campaign from their perspective.
