    <p class="h3">Ultramarines Second Company</p>
    <p>
        Cato Sicarius was cleaning out an infestation of orks with his 2nd Company in a nearby system when he received a message. An Inquisitor which Sicarius had worked with before contacted him about something called the 'exodus project'. Most of the information was classified but Cato still directed half of his company towards the listed sector and instructed the remaining half to follow once the ork menace was dealt with. With the orders to execute the so called 'traitors' who supported exodus, Sicarius would have his work cut out for him as multiple imperial signatures were detected upon arrival, but there no clear indication to where their loyalties laid.
