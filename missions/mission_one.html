                Currently, after several months of an intense and secret recuriting campaign very few have responded to the call of the Exodus Crusade. It is little more than an Adeptus Astartes Chapter fleet. The only ones to have responded to the call is a handful of rogue traders and refugees from death worlds! Not a single Astartes! Not One Guard Regiment! Only our inquisitorial entourage comprised of Miscreants, refugees and allied xenos.  Our only hope now is that our own Imperium allies do not beleive we are heretics! The first leg is passing Mccragge hopefully the virtuos  Ultramarines might be able to lend us assitance.

                Mission: Prepare for Boarders
            </h3>
            <!--Intent is to simulate drop pod boarding action with a rule to simulate being damaged from such a manouvre and space would be limited to infantry, heavy infantry(terminators, wraithblades/guard) etc. 1 CP for custom pod to bring along biker units, and walkers etc. -->
            <article>
                <p>
               <h5 class = "text-center">MISSION Setup:</h5>
               Bring a Power Level 25 force from your list it may ONLY INCLUDE units with the infantry or biker keywords.   
               <br>
                The Battlefield size is 44" by 30" and the mission type is a standard objective control mission with 2 objective markers in the Attacker's deployment zone and the Defender's deployment zone.
                <br>
                The Deployment zone is 8" from the board edge of the 30" board side.
                <br>
                Both player's need to setup terrian to simulate what they believe a boarded imperium starship or rogue trader cruiser would look like. 
                <br>
                Select an Attacker and Defender.  
                <br>
                Defender must be an Exodus aligned player.  If neither player is not Exodus aligned then select who is the Defender and who is Attacker. 
                <br>
                Since this mission is simulating a deep space engagement units with deep strike abilities cannot be used except for the DELAYED PODS and MAINTENANCE ARRIVAL STRATAGEM!!! 
                <br>
                Additionally, if you bring a unit that allows forward deployment, ie free move, deploying outside your deployment zone, this will be reduced to the following: At the start of the game but before the first turn begins you may move your unit forward up to 7".
                <br>

                <h5 class = "text-center">Objectives:</h5>
                <p>Each player has two objective markers which they place in their respective deployment zones.  
                    <br>
                    At the start of each command phase starting in Battle Round two receive 10 victory points  for meeting each of the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Control One or more Objective markers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control Two or more Objective marker
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control three or more Objective markers
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <article>
            <p>
                NOTE: This mission objective cannot be scored in the first round.  
                <br>
                <h5 class = "text-center">Bonus Objectives:</h5>
                
                The Defender needs to REPEL THE BOARDERS and scores 5 points for each enemy unit that is destroyed.  Additonally they will gain 10 victory points for each objective marker they control in the Attacker's Deployment Zone the end of the game. 
                
                Attacker gains 5 victory points for each enemy unit they kill. Additonally they will gain 10 victory points for each objective marker they control in the Defender's Deployment Zone the end of the last battle round. 
                <br>
                Optional rule ZERO-G: Your ships gravity systems have been taken out.  When you choose a unit to fire with pistol type weapons fall back 1". Assualt, Rapid fire type weapons in the shooting phase move them back in the opposite direction by 1d3".  Heavy and Blast weapons the unit moves in the opposite direction of the target by 2+1d3".  Grenades, every unit within 6 inches of the target unit moves back 1d3".  If this pushes a unit within engagement range of an enemy unit they will fight as normal in the fight phase.
