                Exodus Crusade Rendezvous
            </h3>
            <p>
                Currently, after several months in secret on an active recuriting campaign each order that has responded to the call the exodus crusade is little more than Adeptus Astartes Chapter fleet. The only onese to have responded to the call is a handful of rogue traders, and refugees from death worlds. Not one Chapter, not One guard regiment, only miscreants, refugees and tolerable xenos who we believe are up to their own mischief.  Our only hope is that our own Imperium allies do not turn on us considering what our own fleet is formed from.  The first leg is passing Mccragge hopefully the virtuos  Ultramarines would be able to lend us assitance.

                Mission: Prepare for Boarders
            </h3>
            <!--Intent is to simulate drop pod boarding action with a rule to simulate being damaged from such a manouvre and space would be limited to infantry, heavy infantry(terminators, wraithblades/guard) etc. 1 CP for custom pod to bring along biker units, and walkers etc. -->
            <p class>
                MISSION Setup:
                Battlefield size is 44" by 30" and is a combat control. 
                Player's Deployment zone is 8" from the board edge of the 30" side.
                Setup terrian to simulate an Imperium Cruiser or rogue trader being boarded. 
                Select an Attacker and Defender.  
                Defender must be Exodus aligned if not then select who is the Defender and who is Attacker. Due to being a space engagement ALL DEEP STRIKE ABILITIES CANNOT BE USED!!!  
                <br>
                Each player has two objective markers to deploy in their deployment zones.  You receive 10 victory points for meeting each of the following conditions:
            </p>
            <p>
                Main Objective:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Control One or more Objective markers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control Two or more Objective marker
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control three or more Objective markers
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE: This mission objective cannot be scored in the first round.  
                <br>
                Bonus Objectives:
                
                The Defender needs to REPEL THE BOARDERS and scores 5 points for each enemy unit that is destroyed.  Additonally they will gain 10 victory points for each objective marker they control in the Attacker's Deployment Zone the end of the game. 
                
                Attacker gains 5 victory points for each enemy unit they kill. Additonally they will gain 10 victory points for each objective marker they control in the Defender's Deployment Zone the end of the last battle round. 
                <br>
                Optional rule ZERO-G: Your ships gravity systems have been taken out.  When you choose a unit to fire with pistol type weapons fall back 1". Assualt, Rapid fire type weapons in the shooting phase move them back in the opposite direction by 1d3".  Heavy and Blast weapons the unit moves in the opposite direction of the target by 2+1d3".  Grenades, every unit within 6 inches of the target unit moves back 1d3".  If this pushes a unit within engagement range of an enemy unit they will fight as normal in the fight phase. 

                <br>
                STRATS:
                1 CP Delayed Boarding: Select one unit from your army and set it aside.  It can be brought in on in a subsequent turn at the end of your movement phase within 6" of any board edge.  
                1 CP Modded Design:  Due to a unique design of your ship or boarding pod you are able to bring a single walker, battlesuit, biker or dreadnought unit for this opening mission. Cannot be stacked with Delayed Boarding.
